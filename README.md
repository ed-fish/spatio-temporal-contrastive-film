# Spatio Temporal Contrastive Video Learning: Pytorch implementation
A Pytorch implementation of Spatio Temporal Contrastive Video Representation Learning : https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03800
I am not an author of this paper and my implementation is based on assumptions derived from the paper. 


## WIP
Model is able to train using ResNet50 and NT-Xent loss. You can train the model using the logging object shown in main().

Evalution includes K-Means Clustering and PCA. 

The model still needs a lot of refactoring and review so I would not use for experimentation until version 0.1 is complete.
